Bayesian Functional Genome-wide Association Study (BFGWAS) 
---
**BFGWAS** tool conducts GWAS based on a multivariable Bayeisan variable selection model that accounts for functional genomic information and LD.

#### We now provide an updated version of this tool, [**BFGWAS_SS**](https://github.com/yjingj/BFGWAS_SS), which can handle GWAS summary data with GWAS Z-score and reference LD files.
